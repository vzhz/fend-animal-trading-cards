Hello! I practiced some CSS here.

You can see the mockup I was to emutate.
The results of my code can be previewed [here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/vzhz/fend-animal-trading-cards/blob/master/index-veronica-card.html).

Corrently my concerns are:
- It seems that my CSS is redundant re: borders, width, and padding, but I get the CSS to apply to multiple elements.
- I used width: 300px to make the other elements the same width as the image, but that caused me trouble with my bullet points (li) because they are shifted to the right. I am not sure how to force them to the left. Iâ€™ve tried text-align: left and padding: 0 but so far nothing has worked.

Thank you! Feel free to comment inline or whatever is easiest for you!
